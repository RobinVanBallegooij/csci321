
PathPlannerApp Manual and Tutorial.doc is a path planning-tutorial that provides a detailed explanation and pseudocode.

In order to get the most out of the tutorial, you should start with the "PathPlannerApp.base" and avoid looking through the "PathPlannerApp.solution" untill you have completed the project.

The projects are setup such that their "working directory" and "Output directory" are the parent directory of the Src folder. 

Note: For the "PathPlannerApp", you must open a collision map file before hitting the triangle "Start" button.
