\item[Python] For python on windows I like installing python using the
  Anaconda package, because you get tons of important scientific
  packages automatically loaded.

\item[Other Packages] For installing unincluded packages on Windows, the
  most reliable method I've found is to use the unofficial binaries
  found here:

  \url{http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/}

  These are ``wheel'' files which are installed with {\tt pip}.
  {\tt  pip} comes with the Anaconda package.  Run a command prompt,
  cd to the Anaconda directory, and run:


  \fbox{\tt pip install packagename.whl}


  Packages you may want to consider:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item pygame
  \item pymunk
  \item box2d
  \item pyglet
  \end{itemize}
